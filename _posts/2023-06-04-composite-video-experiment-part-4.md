Data corruption is inevitable when sending bits along a wire. In the case of this project, sending the data collected for a single PAL field across UART, at a baud rate of 115200, reliably produces some data corruption. To implement a reliable communication protocol that can deal with this unreliable physical link, it's useful to know when data in the message has been unexpectedly changed. The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is a robust way of achieving this.

## Simple methods to detect data corruption
Perhaps the simplest way to detect data corruption is with a parity bit appended to the data being sent. The bit is set to 1 if there are an odd number of set bits in the data and 0 otherwise. This is better than nothing, but isn't very reliable. If two bits flip, the parity bit will remain unchanged and the receiver won't know that data corruption occurred. 

A smarter approach is to take the sum of all bytes in the data being sent, modulo 256, and append the resultant byte to the payload. The original [XMODEM protocol](https://techheap.packetizer.com/communication/modems/xmodem.html) uses this checksum. Note that, since there are only 256 possible values for a byte, an arbitrary byte will be the correct checksum, on average, once in every 256 data payloads. In fact, `0x80 + 0x80 = 0x100 = 0x00 (mod 256)`, and thus it's possible to have undetected data corruption with only two flipped bits!

## The cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
The cyclic redundancy check is a much more effective method to detect data corruption. According the [Koopman](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/crc/), an [appropriately chosen 32-bit CRC](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/crc/c32/0x9960034c_len.txt) is guaranteed to detect 6 bit flips (Hamming distance of 6) in any message of length up to 32738 bits.

The CRC of a message `M` of length `L` bits is computed using polynomial long division over the field of integers mod 2:
1. Let `F` be the field of integers mod 2 and `g` the polynomial of degree `n` over `F` associated with the CRC being computed. CRC-32C, CRC-32K/6.4, CCITT-16, etc. each have a different polynomial. 
2. Write `M` as a string of bits and consider `M` as a representation of a polynomial of degree `L - 1` over `F`, the most significant bit corresponding to the highest power of the polynomial.
3. Compute the remainder `r` following the polynomial long division `(M * x^n ) / g` over `F`.
4. The coefficients of `r` give the resultant CRC 'checksum'.

A received (`message`, `crc`) pair can be checked for data corruption in two equivalent ways:
- The CRC algorithm can be computed on `message` and the result, `val`, compared against the value of `crc`. If `val != crc` then data corruption was detected.
- The CRC algorithm can be computed on the *codeword* (fancy name for the `message` and `crc` bits taken as a single contiguous value). Since addition and subtraction are equivalent over the field of integers mod 2, the codeword is equal to `M * x^n + r = M * x^n - r`, which is perfectly divisible by `g`. Therefore, if the result is non-zero, data corruption was detected.

### Common modifications
Consider the messages `11`, `011`, `0011`. When viewed as polynomials, they are equivalent: `x + 1 = 0x^2 + x + 1 = 0x^3 + 0x^2 + x + 1`. This means that they will each result in the same CRC value. To remedy this, it is common to flip the first `n` bits of the message before computing the CRC checksum.

When applying the CRC algorithm to the entire codeword, appending additional `0`s to a valid codeword results in another valid codeword: if `g` divides `h`, then `g` also divides `h * x`. To get around this, the checksum can be inverted before being appended to the message. This means that instead of checking that a received codeword is perfectly divisible by `g`, the receiver must check that the remainder is equal to a known value called the *residue*. The residue is uniquely determined by the polynomial `g` used.

### Burst error detection
The Hamming distance between message polynomials with the same CRC value is one part of CRC performance. The 32-bit CRC generator polynomial mentioned above guarantees that if 1 to 6 bits in the message are flipped, the CRC will detect it. Another important component of CRC performance is *burst error* detection. A burst error of length `k` refers to a contiguous sequence of `k` bits where the first and last have been flipped; some of the interior bits may also have been flipped. Interestingly, a 32-bit CRC is guaranteed to detect any burst error of length less than or equal to `32`. Nice! Furthermore, since there are `2^32` possible CRC checksum values and CRC checksums are distributed with equal probability, larger burst error will be detected with probability tending towards the worst-case limit of `1-(1/2)^32 = 0.99999999976716935634613037109375` as the length of the burst error increases.

### UART considerations
Since burst errors are typically the result of something happening at the hardware/electrical level, the CRC implementation needs to account for the order the bits are sent along the wire in order to detect them. In particular, UART transmits data byte by byte, **least significant bit first**. This means that the 'in-flight' message bits are not the same as the contiguous bits in memory that make up the data. A 32-bit burst error on the wire can become a 40-bit burst error in memory for the receiver, which can go undetected. Therefore, it's the in-flight bits that correspond to `M` above and need to be CRC checksummed.  Rather than making a copy of the message in memory, with each byte reversed, and computing the CRC checksum on that, the bits of the CRC polynomial can be reversed, e.g. `110100 -> 001011`, and corresponding modifications made to the typical (software) CRC implementation.
