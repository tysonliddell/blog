**Exercise 1.3.1** Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be events with probabilities $$\prob(A)=
\frac{3}{4}$$ and $$\prob(B) = \frac{1}{3}$$.

(a) Show that $$\frac{1}{12} \leq \prob(A \cap B) \leq \frac{1}{3}$$, and (b) give examples to show that both extremes are possible. (c) Find corresponding bounds for $$\prob(A \cup B)$$.

*Solution*:

(a) Since $$A \cap B \subset B$$, it follows that $$\prob(A \cap B) \leq
\prob(B) = \frac{1}{3}$$. The lower bound comes from the fact that there is not
enough "probability mass" to go share between the events $$A$$ and $$B$$
disjointly, since the sum of their individual probabilities is $$\frac{13}{12} >
1$$. That is

$$
\begin{align*}
\prob(A \cap B)
&= \prob(A) + \prob(B) - \prob(A \cup B) \\
&\geq \prob(A) + \prob(B) - 1 \\
&= \frac{13}{12} - 1 \\
&= \frac{1}{12}.
\end{align*}
$$

(b) Let $$\Om = \{1,2,\ldots,12\}$$ and $$\prob(\om) = \frac{1}{12}$$ for each
$$\om \in \Om$$. Consider the events $$A' = \{1,2,\ldots,9\}$$, $$B' = \{
1,2,3,4 \}$$ and $$B'' = \{9,10,11,12\}$$, satisfying $$P(A') = \frac{3}{4}$$
and $$\prob(B') = \prob(B'') = \frac{1}{3}$$. The upper bound in (a) is achieved
with $$\prob(A' \cap B') = \frac{1}{3}$$, and the lower bound with $$\prob(A'
\cap B'') = \frac{1}{12}$$.

(c) To obtain a lower bound, observe that $$A,B \subset A \cup B$$ implies that
$$\prob(A \cup B) \geq \max\left\{\frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{3}\right\} =
\frac{3}{4}$$. An upper bound is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
\prob(A \cup B)
&= \prob(A) + \prob(B) - \prob(A \cap B) \\
&\leq \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{12} && \text{from (a)}\\
&= 1.
\end{align*}
$$

To summarise, $$\frac{3}{4} \leq \prob(A \cup B) \leq 1$$. These bounds are
attained using the same events $$A'$$, $$B'$$ and $$B''$$ from (b).
