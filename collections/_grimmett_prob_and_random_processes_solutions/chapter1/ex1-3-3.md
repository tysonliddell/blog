**Exercise 1.3.3** Six cups and saucers come in pairs: there are two cups and
saucers which are red, two white, and two with stars on. If the cups are placed
randomly onto the saucers (one each), find the probability that no cup is upon a
saucer of the same pattern.

*Solution*: Let $$\text{RRWWSS}$$ represent the layout of the saucers. Any
arrangement of the cups corresponds to a permutation of this string, and so we
use a sample space $$\Om$$ of the set of all such permutations for this
experiment. If the cups are placed randomly, each permutation of this string is
equally likely to occur. There are $$\\|\Om\\| = \frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90$$ such
permutations possible.

This problem can be solved by exhausting all the possibilities. There are two
ways to permute the string that group the patterns together: $$\text{WWSSRR}$$
and $$\text{SSRRWW}$$. If the patterns are not kept together, each group in the
original string will contain one of each of the other two patterns after
permuting; $$A = \text{WSRSRW}$$ is one such example. The rest of the
possibilities comes from swapping each adjacent pair in $$A$$. There are $$2
\cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$$ ways to do this. Therefore,

$$
\prob(\text{no cup lands on saucer of same pattern})
= \frac{2+8}{90}
= \frac{1}{9}.
$$
